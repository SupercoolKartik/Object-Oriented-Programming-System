Class is a **blueprint or template for creating [[03. Objects | Objects]]**. It defines the properties (attributes or data) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of that class will have.

Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects of a particular type.
For example, if you were designing a program to model cars, you might create a class called "Car" that defines properties such as model, color, and behaviors such as driving, braking, and turning.

**Once a class is defined, you can create multiple objects (instances) based on that class, each with its own set of properties and behaviors**. These objects can interact with each other and with other parts of the program.

#Car_Class
```
// Define the Car class
class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    string color;
    

public:
	int year;

    // Constructor to initialize object properties
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, string carColor, int carYear) {
        make = carMake;
        model = carModel;
        color = carColor;
        year = carYear;
    }

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Color: " << color << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }

    // Method to simulate the car driving
    void drive() {
        cout << "The " << color << " " << make << " " << model << " is driving." << endl;
    }

    // Method to simulate the car braking
    void brake() {
        cout << "The " << color << " " << make << " " << model << " is braking." << endl;
    }
};

```

#### MY NOTES
#Hero_Class
```
class Hero {
private:
    char level;
    int health;
    

public:
	char name;

	//Getter functions for health and level
    int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }

    char getLevel() {
        return level;
    }

	//Setter functions for health and level
    void setHealth(int val) {
        this->health = val;
    }

    void setLevel(char val) {
        this->level = val;
    }
    
};

```
What is [[this]] here?
