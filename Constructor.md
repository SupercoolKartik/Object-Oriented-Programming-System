In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a constructor is a special type of method that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the newly created object's state (i.e., set up its initial values or perform any necessary setup tasks).

- **Name**: Constructors **have the same name as the class** in which they are defined.
- **No Return Type**: Constructors **do not have a return type**, not even 'void'. This is because they are automatically invoked during object creation and are responsible for initializing the object, not returning a value.
- 1. **Initialization**: Constructors initialize the object's data members (also known as instance variables or properties) to appropriate initial values. This can involve assigning values to data members, allocating memory, or performing any other necessary setup tasks.
- 1. **Automatic Invocation**: Constructors are automatically called when an object is created. They are invoked implicitly by the 'new' operator (in C++) or explicitly when an object is declared.
- 1. **Multiple Constructors**: A class can have multiple constructors, each with a different set of parameters. This allows for object creation with different initializations or for handling different scenarios.
- 1. **Default Constructor**: If no constructor is defined in a class, the compiler provides a default constructor, which initializes the object's data members to default values (e.g., zero for numeric types, empty string for strings).

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    string color;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor with parameters
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, string carColor, int carYear) {
        make = carMake;
        model = carModel;
        color = carColor;
        year = carYear;
    }

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Color: " << color << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a Car object using the constructor with parameters
    Car myCar("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue", 2022);

    // Display information about the car
    myCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}

```
### Default Constructor
If no constructors are explicitly declared in the class, a default constructor is provided automatically by the compiler.
They are used to create objects, which do not have any specific initial value.

A default constructor is a special type of constructor in object-oriented programming that is automatically generated by the compiler if no other constructor is explicitly defined in a class. It is called the "default" constructor because it is used to initialize objects when they are created without any arguments.
1. **Automatic Generation**: If a class does not explicitly define any constructors, the compiler provides a default constructor automatically.
2. 1. **No Parameters**: Default constructors do not accept any parameters. They initialize the object's data members to default values.
3. 1. **Initialization**: Default constructors initialize the object's data members to default values. For built-in types (e.g., int, double), the default value is typically zero. For user-defined types (e.g., objects, pointers), the default value depends on the type.
4. 1. **Implicit Invocation**: Default constructors are implicitly invoked when objects are created without any arguments. They initialize the object's state before any other code in the constructor body executes.
5. 1. **Use Cases**: Default constructors are useful when you want to create objects with default initial values or when you need a constructor for objects that don't require any special initialization logic.


##### Constructor with default values?
If you need to provide default values for constructor parameters, you can achieve this by overloading the constructor, providing multiple constructors with different parameter lists. One of the overloaded constructors can have default arguments. However, this constructor would not be a default constructor.

(You can set default valued while programming a constructor function so if the object is initiated with some arguments, those argument will be set to the properties of the object but if you initiate an object without any arguments the default values will be set)

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    string color;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor with default parameter values
    Car(string carMake = "Unknown", string carModel = "Unknown", string carColor = "Unknown", int carYear = 0) {
        make = carMake;
        model = carModel;
        color = carColor;
        year = carYear;
    }

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Color: " << color << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a Car object using the constructor with default parameter values
    Car myCar; // No arguments provided, default values will be used

    // Display information about the car
    myCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}

```


##### If you define a constructor with parameters in a class, Can you can still create objects without providing arguments?
Yes, however, you'll need to define a separate constructor in the same class that does not require any parameters. If you define another constructor function with no parameters (also called a parameterless constructor or default constructor), then you can create objects without providing arguments.

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    string color;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor with parameters
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, string carColor, int carYear) {
        make = carMake;
        model = carModel;
        color = carColor;
        year = carYear;
    }

    // Default constructor (constructor without parameters)
    Car() {
        make = "Unknown";
        model = "Unknown";
        color = "Unknown";
        year = 0;
    }

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Color: " << color << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a Car object using the constructor with parameters
    Car myCar("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue", 2022);
    // Display information about the car
    myCar.displayInfo();

    // Create a Car object using the default constructor
    Car defaultCar;
    // Display information about the default car
    defaultCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}

```

----
#### Constructor
- Runs automatically when an object is formed
- Every class has its own constructor function
- Constructor function can be explicitly made the programmer to do specific things and the default constructor will be vanished

##### Non Parameterized Constructor

```
//Creating object statically
Hero Suraj;
	or
Hero Suraj();

//Creating object Dynamically
Hero* Suraj = new Hero;
	or
Hero* Suraj = new Hero();
```
(You'll find the #Hero_Class in [[Class]])
##### Parameterized Constructor
1. First we'll have to make a constructor function which arguments
```
Class Hero(int health){
	this->health=health;
}
```
Note: What is [[this]]?

Note: Once you make a parameterized constructor, the old defalut constructor function will be vanised and objexts can then only be made with argument values ( unless you make another default constructor function with no parameters, mentioned above).

2. Then we can create objects
```
//Creating object statically
Hero Suraj(50);

//Creating object dynamically
Hero* Suraj = new Hero(50);

```
Now it will call the constructor automatically and assign the value 50 to the 'health' property of 'Suraj' object
