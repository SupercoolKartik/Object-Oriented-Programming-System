A **copy constructor** is a member function(function that is associated with a specific class or object) which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously.

Copy constructor is used to initialize the members of a newly created object by copying the members of an already existing object

The process of initializing members of an object through a copy constructor is known as **copy initialization**. It is also called **member-wise initialization** because the copy constructor initializes one object with the existing object, both belonging to the same class on a member by member copy basis.

 **Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.**

Note: Class members in the example below is initialized using [[10. Initialization List | Initialization List]] syntax.

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, int carYear) : make(carMake), model(carModel), year(carYear) {}

    // Copy constructor
    Car(const Car& other) : make(other.make), model(other.model), year(other.year) {}

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a Car object
    Car originalCar("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);

    // Create a copy of the original car using the copy constructor
    Car copiedCar = originalCar;

    // Display information about the original car
    cout << "Original Car:" << endl;
    originalCar.displayInfo();

    // Display information about the copied car
    cout << "\nCopied Car:" << endl;
    copiedCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}


```

==**Q. When is a Copy Constructor Called in C++?**==
The Copy constructor is called mainly when a new object is created from an existing object, as a copy of the existing object.
In C++, a Copy Constructor may be called for the following cases:
1. When an object of the class is returned by value.   
2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument.   
3. object is constructed based on another object of the same class.  
4. When an object is constructed using initialization lists with braces   
5. When the compiler generates a temporary object.

==**Q.  Why should we not pass the object by value in the copy constructor?**==
Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument. If you pass the object by value in the copy constructor, it would result in a recursive call to the copy constructor itself. 
This happens because passing by value involves making a copy, and making a copy involves calling the copy constructor, leading to an infinite loop. Using a reference avoids this recursion. So we use reference of Objects to avoid infinite calls

#### My Notes
###### Copy Constructor
Just like the normal constructor, there is a default copy constructor in any class which gets called when a new object needs to be created as a copy of an existing object.
As the name suggests, it copies properties of an existing object of the same class into another.

**Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.**

```
	Hero h1 = (10,'B);
	Hero h2 = h1; or Hero h2(h1);
```

We can create our own copy constructor, after the creation of our own constructor function the default one will vanish.

```
Class Hero{
	private:
		.
		.
		.
	public:
		Hero(Hero& temp){
			this->health = temp.health;
			this->level= temp.level;
		}
};
```
Note: We cannot pass parameters in the copy constructor by value, we will have to pass them by reference,
else it will throw error;
```
Hero( Hero temp){
		.
		.
}
```
the above code will throw errors
