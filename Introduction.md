Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that **focuses on organizing code into self-contained units called [[objects]], which represent real-world entities**. Each object has its own **state (attributes or properties)** and **behavior (methods or functions)**. 

OOP promotes concepts like [[encapsulation]], [[inheritance]], [[polymorphism]], and [[abstraction]] to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

It enables developers to model complex systems more intuitively by mimicking real-world relationships and interactions between objects.
