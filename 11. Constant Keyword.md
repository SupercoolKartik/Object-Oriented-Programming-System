### 1. Constant Member Variables

A member variable of a class can be made constant by using the `const` keyword. A constant member variable must be initialized at the time of its declaration or within the constructor's initializer list.

**Ensures that the member variable cannot be modified after initialization.**

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Car {
private:
    const string make; // Constant member variable
    string model;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, int carYear) 
        : make(carMake), model(carModel), year(carYear) {}

    // Method to display information about the car
    void displayInfo() const {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
    void changeMake(string m){
        this->make=m;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
    car1.displayInfo();
    //car1.changeItem("Honda");  // Changing the const variable make of this object like this will give error
    //car1.displayInfo();
    return 0;
}

```

### 2. Constant Member Functions

A member function can be made constant by **appending the 'const' keyword after the function declaration**. This **indicates that the function does not modify** any member variables of the class.

**These functions guarantees no not modify any member variables of the object**. They can be called on both 'const' and non-'const' objects.

```
.
.
.
.

    // Constant member function
    void displayInfo() const {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }

    // Non-constant member function
    void setModel(string newModel) {
        model = newModel;
.
.
.
.

```

**Note:** You cannot make the `setModel` function a constant member function if it is intended to modify the member variable `model`. **A constant member function is one that guarantees not to modify any member variables of the class**. Since the purpose of `setModel` is to change the value of `model`, it inherently modifies the state of the object, and thus cannot be declared as `const`.


### 3. Constant Parameters

Function parameters can be made constant to prevent modification within the function. This is useful for passing large objects by reference without allowing the function to modify them.

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, int carYear) 
        : make(carMake), model(carModel), year(carYear) {}

    // Constant member function
    void displayInfo() const {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }

    // Function with const parameter
    void updateModel(const string& newModel) {
        //newModel = "Swift"; //--> Here the newModel value cannot be changed unless we remove the const keyword in the argument
        model = newModel;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
    car1.displayInfo();
    
    string newModel = "Corolla";
    car1.updateModel(newModel);  // Update the model
    car1.displayInfo();
    
    return 0;
}

```

**Note:** The `newModel` parameter is `const`, meaning that `updateModel` cannot modify `newModel` itself. However, the member variable `model` of the `Car` class is being assigned the value of `newModel`. This means that `newModel` is used to update the value of `model`, but `newModel` itself remains unchanged.
**This use of `const` ensures that the input parameter is read-only and cannot be altered by the function.**


### 4. Constant Objects

An object of a class can be made constant by using the `const` keyword. This means that **none of its member variables can be modified** after the object is created, and **only constant member functions can be called on the object**.

```

class Car {
private:
    string make;
    string model;
    int year;

public:
    // Constructor
    Car(string carMake, string carModel, int carYear) 
        : make(carMake), model(carModel), year(carYear) {}

    // Constant member function
    void displayMake() const {
        cout << "Make: " << make << endl;
    }
    void displayModel() const {
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
    }
    
    //----------> THIS IS NOT A CONST MEMBER FUNCTION
    // void displayYear(){
    //     cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    // }

    // Non-constant member function
    void setModel(string newModel) {
        model = newModel;
    }
};

int main() {
    const Car car1("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
    car1.displayMake();
    car1.displayModel();
    // car1.displayYear();      // displayYear() WILL GIVE ERRORS AS IT IS NOT A CONST MEMBER FUNCTION BUT BEING CALLED FOR A CONST OBJECT
    // car1.setModel("Corolla"); // This would cause a compile-time error
    return 0;
}

```
