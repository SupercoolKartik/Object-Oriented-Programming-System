Objects are instances of classes. When you create a class, you are essentially creating a blueprint or a template. Objects are then created based on this blueprint, and each object has its own set of properties and behaviors.
When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

We can create multiple objects of this #Car_Class, each representing a specific car. Each car object would have its own unique properties, such as make, model, color, and year. By "unique properties," It means that each object of the `Car` class can have different values for its properties.
```
// Create objects of the Car class 

Car car1("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue", 2022); 
Car car2("Honda", "Accord", "Red", 2023);

// Call the displayInfo() method for each car object 
car1.displayInfo();
```

#### MY NOTES

Creating an object of the class Hero

```
.
.
.
int main(){
	Hero h1;
	Hero h1(); -> (h1 object of Hero type)
}

```
