Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 

**Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.**

Abstraction is often used alongside [[14. Encapsulation | encapsulation]], which hides the internal state and requires all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

Consider aÂ **real-life example of a man driving a car**. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc. in the car. This is what abstraction is.

### Types of Abstraction
#### 1. Data Abstraction
**Data Abstraction focuses on what data an object holds and how it is manipulated, rather than how the data is stored or maintained.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is a key principle in achieving data abstraction. By encapsulating data within classes and providing access through public methods, we hide the internal state of the object.
- **Access Modifiers:** Access modifiers (private, protected, and public) are used to control the visibility of class members. Only the relevant information is exposed to the outside world.

#### 2. Control Abstraction
**Control Abstraction** involves abstracting the control flow of a program. It is achieved by using functions, methods, and classes to hide the implementation details of control structures and algorithms.

- **Functions and Methods:** Functions and methods encapsulate a block of code, providing a simpler interface for invoking complex operations.
- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows the same operation to be performed in different ways, enhancing control abstraction by using a common interface.
