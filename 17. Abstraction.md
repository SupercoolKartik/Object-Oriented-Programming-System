Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 

**Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.**

Abstraction is often used alongside [[14. Encapsulation | encapsulation]], which hides the internal state and requires all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

Consider a **real-life example of a man driving a car**. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc. in the car. This is what abstraction is.

### Abstraction using Access Specifiers
Access specifiers are the main pillar of implementing abstraction in C++. We can use access specifiers to enforce restrictions on class members. For example:

- Members declared as **public** in a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
- Members declared as **private** in a class, can be accessed only from within the class. They are not allowed to be accessed from any part of the code outside the class.

We can easily implement abstraction using the above two features provided by access specifiers. Say, the **members that define the internal implementation can be marked as private** in a class. And the **important information needed to be given to the outside world can be marked as public**. And these public members can access the private members as they are inside the class.

**Example:**
```
// C++ Program to Demonstrate the
// working of Abstraction
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class implementAbstraction {
private:
	int a, b;

public:
	// method to set values of
	// private members
	void set(int x, int y)
	{
		a = x;
		b = y;
	}

	void display()
	{
		cout << "a = " << a << endl;
		cout << "b = " << b << endl;
	}
};

int main()
{
	implementAbstraction obj;
	obj.set(10, 20);
	obj.display();
	return 0;
}
```
```
OUTPUT
	a = 10
	b = 20
```

### Types of Abstraction

#### 1. Data Abstraction

- **Focuses on data entities.**
- **Hides the internal representation and implementation of data.**
- **Exposes only essential information to the outside world.**
- **Achieved through classes and interfaces.**

**Example:** A `Car` class can have attributes like `color`, `model`, and `price`, but the internal details of how these attributes are stored are hidden. Users can interact with the car object without knowing the underlying data structures.

#### 2. Process Abstraction

- **Focuses on the processes or methods.**
- **Hides the internal implementation of a process.**
- **Exposes only the functionality of the process.**
- **Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.**

**Example:** A `Calculator` class can have methods like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, but the internal logic of how these operations are performed is hidden. Users can use the calculator without knowing the exact algorithms involved.

**In essence, data abstraction deals with the "what" of data, while process abstraction deals with the "how" of operations.**


### Abstraction in Header files
One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate the power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating the power of numbers.


### Advantages of Data Abstraction
- **Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code:** By using abstraction, users interact with high-level interfaces without needing to understand the underlying implementation details. For example, when you use a `sort` function in a library, you don’t need to know the specific sorting algorithm used or how it’s implemented at a low level. This simplifies the coding process and allows the programmer to focus on solving higher-level problems.
- **Avoids code duplication and increases reusability:**
- **Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user:** One of the key benefits of abstraction is that the internal workings of a class can be modified without affecting the code that uses the class. This is **because users of the class interact with it through a well-defined interface.** For example, you can optimize the performance of a `Database` class by changing its internal query execution logic without changing the methods that the users of the class call to perform database operations.
- **Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user:** By exposing only the necessary details and hiding the internal implementation, abstraction enhances the security of an application. Users cannot access or modify the internal state of an object directly, reducing the risk of unintended interference.
- **It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability:** Abstraction helps in managing complexity by breaking down the code into manageable sections. Each class or method abstracts a specific piece of functionality, making the overall codebase easier to understand and maintain. This modular approach avoids redundancy since common functionalities are encapsulated in reusable components. For example, a `Shape` class hierarchy (with `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.) allows different shapes to be managed through a common interface, simplifying the overall design and making it easier to add new shapes in the future.
