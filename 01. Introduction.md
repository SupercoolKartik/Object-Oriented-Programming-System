Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that **focuses on organizing code into self-contained units called [[03. Objects | Objects]], which represent real-world entities**. Each object has its own **state (attributes or properties)** and **behavior (methods or functions)**. 

OOP promotes concepts like [[14. Encapsulation | Encapsulation]], [[15. Inheritance | Inheritance]], [[16. polymorphism | polymorphism]], and [[abstraction]] to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

It enables developers to model complex systems more intuitively by mimicking real-world relationships and interactions between objects.
