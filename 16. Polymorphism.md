 The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. 
Poly -> Many
Morph -> Forms

**Polymorphism is defined as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.**
A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.


## Types of Polymorphism
- **Compile-time Polymorphism**
- **Runtime Polymorphism**


##  Compile-Time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by **function overloading** or **operator overloading.**


#### A. Function Overloading

Function overloading **allows you to have multiple functions with the same name** in the same scope. The **compiler determines which function to call based on the number and types of arguments** passed to the function.


```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) {
        cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
    }
    
    void show(int a, int b){
        cout << "Integers: "<< a<<","<<b<<endl;    
    }
    
    void show(double d) {
        cout << "Double: " << d << endl;
    }

    void show(string s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print p;
    p.show(5);         // Calls show(int)
    p.show(6,7);       // Calls show(int,int)
    p.show(3.14);      // Calls show(double)
    p.show("Hello");   // Calls show(string)
    return 0;
}

```

#### B. Operator Overloading
Operator overloading **allows defining or altering the behavior of operators for user-defined types (classes or structs)**. This enhances the readability and usability of objects of those classes.
It is a compile-time polymorphism.
It is an idea of giving special meaning to an existing operator in C++ without changing its original meaning.

**For example**, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.

In this example bellow, we have 3 variables “a1”, “a2” and “a3” of type “class A”.

```
class A {
    statements;
};

int main()
{
    A a1, a2, a3;

    a3 = a1 + a2;

    return 0;
}
```

Here we are trying to add two objects “a1” and “a2”, which are of user-defined type i.e. of type “class A” using the “+” operator. This is not allowed, because the addition operator “+” is predefined to operate only on built-in data types. But here, “class A” is a user-defined type, so the compiler generates an error. This is where the concept of “Operator overloading” comes in.

Now, if the user wants to make the operator “+” add two class objects, the user has to redefine the meaning of the “+” operator such that it adds two class objects. This is done by using the concept of “Operator overloading”. So the main idea behind “Operator overloading” is to use C++ operators with class variables or class objects. Redefining the meaning of operators really does not change their original meaning; instead, they have been given additional meaning along with their existing ones.

```
// C++ Program to Demonstrate
// Operator Overloading
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0)
    {
        real = r;
        imag = i;
    }

    // This is automatically called when '+' is used with
    // between two Complex objects
    Complex operator+(Complex const& obj)
    {
        Complex res;
        res.real = real + obj.real;
        res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return res;
    }
    void print() { cout << real << " + i" << imag << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
    c3.print();
}

```

```
Output -> 12 + i9
```

## ==**Can We Overload All Operators?**==

Almost all operators can be overloaded except a few. Following is the list of operators that cannot be overloaded.

sizeof  
typeid  
Scope resolution (::)  
Class member access operators (.(dot), .* (pointer to member operator))  
Ternary or conditional (?:)

## ==**Operators that can be Overloaded in C++**==
We can overload
- **Unary operators**
- **Binary operators**
- **Special operators**( [ ], (), etc)

|Operators that can be overloaded|Examples|
|---|---|
|Binary Arithmetic|+, -, *, /, %|
|Unary Arithmetic|+, -, ++, —|
|Assignment|=, +=,*=, /=,-=, %=|
|Bitwise|& , \| , << , >> , ~ , ^|

## Runtime Polymorphism
## (Late Biding, Dynamic Polymorphism)

This type of polymorphism is achieved by **Function Overriding**.
**The function call is resolved at runtime in runtime polymorphism**. In contrast, with compile time polymorphism, the compiler determines which function call to bind to the object after deducing it at runtime.

#### A. Function Overriding
Function Overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
Function overriding is a type of polymorphism in which we redefine the member function of a class which it inherited from its base class. The function signature remains same but the working of the function is altered to meet the needs of the derived class. So, when we call the function using its name for the parent object, the parent class function is executed. But when we call the function using the child object, the child class version will be executed.

##### Types of Function Overriding in C++
Unlike other languages such as Java where function overriding is strictly done at compile time, C++ supports two types of function overriding:

- Compile Time Overriding
- Runtime Function Overriding

###### Compile Time Function Overriding
In compile time function overriding, **the function call and the definition is binded at the compilation** of the program. Due to this, it is **also called early binding or static binding**.

```
// C++ program to demonstrate compile time function overriding

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    void GeeksforGeeks_Print()
    {
        cout << "Base Function" << endl;
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void GeeksforGeeks_Print()
    {
        cout << "Derived Function" << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Child Child_Derived;
    Child_Derived.GeeksforGeeks_Print();
    return 0;
}

```
```
// Output---> Derived Function
```


```
// C++ Program to illustrate how to implement runtime
// function overriding using virtual function

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    // Declare the function as virtual to allow overriding
    // in derived classes
     void display()
    {
        cout << "Display method of Base class" << endl;
    }

    // Virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of
    // derived class objects
    ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Override the display method
    void display()
    {
        cout << "Display method of Derived class" << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;

    // Point base class pointer to derived class object
    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    // Call the display function
    // This will call the display method of the Derived
    // class due to the virtual function mechanism
    basePtr->display();

    return 0;
}
```
```
// Output --> Display method of Base class
```

###### Runtime Function Overriding using Virtual Function
Function overriding can also be performed at the runtime, which means that function call will be binded to its definition during runtime (also known as late binding or dynamic binding). This can be done with the help of virtual functions.
**The function call is resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object being pointed to, not the type of the pointer/reference.** [[#Detailed Explanation]]

```
class Base {
public:
    virtual func()
    {
        // definition
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    func() override
    {
        // new definition
    }
};
```

 - The `Base` class has a virtual function `func()`. Declaring a function as `virtual` in the base class allows derived classes to override it. This enables runtime polymorphism.
- The `Derived` class overrides the `func()` method. The `override` keyword is used here to indicate that `func()` is intended to override a base class function. This keyword is optional but helps catch errors at compile time if the function does not actually override a base class method.

It is a kind of double check as the program can compile without errors even if the function is not virtual. But then, it will be compile time polymorphism and we won’t get the desired behavior of the function overriding.

```
// C++ Program to illustrate how to implement runtime
// function overriding using virtual function
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    // Declare the function as virtual to allow overriding
    // in derived classes
    virtual void display()
    {
        cout << "Display method of Base class" << endl;
    }

    // Virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of
    // derived class objects
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Override the display method
    void display() override
    {
        cout << "Display method of Derived class" << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;

    // Point base class pointer to derived class object
    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    // Call the display function
    // This will call the display method of the Derived
    // class due to the virtual function mechanism
    basePtr->display();

    return 0;
}
```
```
// Output --> Display method of Derived class
```

#### Advantages of function overriding:
The following are the main advantages of function overriding:

- ==Methods are selected at runtime based on object type== - When a method is overridden in a derived class, the specific **method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not the type of the reference or pointer to the object**.
	```
	Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;

    basePtr     =      &derivedObj;
      |                   |
    reference             actual object (type - Derived)
    or pointer 
    to the object**
    (type - Base)
	```
	
	This feature is known as **dynamic binding** or **late binding**.
	This allows for more [[Flexibility in Code | flexible]] and dynamic code, as the actual method that is executed is based on the object's type at runtime, enabling polymorphic behavior.

- ==Common interfaces and implementations can be reused as we only need to implement the interface for base class== - 
	 Function overriding allows derived classes to provide specific implementations for methods defined in the base class.
	 The **base class defines a common interface**, and **derived classes implement or override that interface.**

- ==Changes in base classes automatically affect derived classes== - When a method is overridden in a derived class, if the base class method is updated, the changes can affect the derived class method indirectly (if the derived class calls the base class method).

- ==Facilitates the implementation of different design patterns== - Many design patterns in software engineering, such as the Strategy Pattern, Factory Method Pattern, and Observer Pattern, rely heavily on polymorphism and function overriding to achieve their goals.

- ==Client code interacts with base class interface, not specific implementations reducing the coupling== -By programming to an interface (base class) rather than an implementation (derived class), the client code becomes less dependent on specific implementations. This is known as **loose coupling**.
