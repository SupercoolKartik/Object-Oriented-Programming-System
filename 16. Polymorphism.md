 The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. 
Poly -> Many
Morph -> Forms

**Polymorphism is defined as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.**
A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.


## Types of Polymorphism
- **Compile-time Polymorphism**
- **Runtime Polymorphism**


##  Compile-Time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by **function overloading** or **operator overloading.**


#### A. Function Overloading

Function overloading **allows you to have multiple functions with the same name** in the same scope. The **compiler determines which function to call based on the number and types of arguments** passed to the function.


```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) {
        cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
    }
    
    void show(int a, int b){
        cout << "Integers: "<< a<<","<<b<<endl;    
    }
    
    void show(double d) {
        cout << "Double: " << d << endl;
    }

    void show(string s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print p;
    p.show(5);         // Calls show(int)
    p.show(6,7);       // Calls show(int,int)
    p.show(3.14);      // Calls show(double)
    p.show("Hello");   // Calls show(string)
    return 0;
}

```
