Static Member Function in a class is the function that is declared as static because of which function attains certain properties as defined below:

- A static member function is **independent of any object** of the class.Â 
- A static member function **can be called even if no objects** of the class exist.
- A static member function **can also be accessed using the class name through the scope resolution operator**.
```
	Car:: staticFun()
```
- A static member function can access static data members and static member functions inside or outside of the class.
- Static member functions have a scope inside the class and cannot access the current object pointer.
- You can also use a static member function to determine how many objects of the class have been created.


**Note:** Static member functions in C++ cannot access non-static data members or non-static member functions directly because they do not operate on a specific instance of the class. Consequently, they do not have a `this` pointer.
However, it can do so indirectly through an instance of the class. Here is an example to illustrate this:

```
// Static member function accessing non-static members through an instance 
static void showCarInfo(const Car& car) { 
	cout << "Make: " << car1.make << endl;     
	cout << "Model: " << car1.model << endl;
	cout << "Year: " << car1.year << endl; 
}
```
